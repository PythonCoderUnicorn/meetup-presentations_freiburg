## RMarkdown - Automated reports

This is an example on how to automate reports with R markdown. 

In this report we analyze group `r params$group`.

```{r, include=FALSE}

file <- params$group

load(file = paste0("data/group_", file, ".RData"))

group

```


## Summary statistics of the group: 

- The mean weight in the group is `r round(mean(group$weight), digits = 2)` 

- The mean age is `r round(mean(group$age), digits = 2)`

The participants com from `r unique(group$city)`
