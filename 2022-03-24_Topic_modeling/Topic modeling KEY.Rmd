# Background

## Introducing topic modeling
- divides text into natural groups
- similar to clustering (on numeric data)
- unsupervised classification

## Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA)
= common algorithm for topic modeling

**Two principles:**

(1) Every document is a mixture of topics
-> document 1: 80% topic A, 15% topic B, 5% topic C
-> document 2: 35% topic A, 55% topic B, 10% topic C

(2) Every topic is a mixture of words
e.g. if we classify newspaper texts into two topics:
-> topic 1 ("politics"): government, law, congress, vote, President...
-> topic 2 ("entertainment"): TV, Hollywood, actor, famous...
But: words can be common in both topics (e.g. budget)


# Code

## Packages and data
```{r}
library(topicmodels)
library(tidytext)
library(tidyverse)
library(gutenbergr)
```

We'll start with the "AssociatedPress" data set:
```{r}
data("AssociatedPress") # part of the topicmodels package
AssociatedPress
```
Data type: Document Term Matrix (more details on this later!)
2246 news articles from an American news agency (published ~1988)

We can use `tidy()` to have a look:
```{r}
tidy(AssociatedPress)
```


## The LDA() function
```{r}
ap_lda <- LDA(AssociatedPress, 
              k = 2, 
              control = list(seed = 1234)) # for reproducible output

ap_lda
```
- k determines how many topics should be created
- in practice, k will often be > 2
- ...and the data sets are usually much larger, too

For more information on how to choose k:
https://juliasilge.com/blog/evaluating-stm/


## Interpretation

### Word-topic probabilities
The `tidy()` function in {tidytext} extracts the per-topic-per-word probabilities (=beta)
```{r}
ap_topics <- tidy(ap_lda, matrix = "beta")

ap_topics
```
beta shows the probability of each term being generated from each topic
e.g. "aaron" has a higher probability of being generated from topic 2 than topic 1

**Scientific notation**
R shows very large or very small numbers in scientific notation
e: multiply the base number by 10 raised to the power of x
You can also think about this as moving the comma to the right or left

```{r}
format(1.4e1, scientific = FALSE) # 1.4 * 10^1
format(1.4e2, scientific = FALSE) # 1.4 * 10^2

format(1.4e-1, scientific = FALSE) # 1.4 * 10^-1
format(1.4e-2, scientific = FALSE) # 1.4 * 10^-2

format(1.686917e-12, scientific = FALSE)
```

#### Words with highest beta per topic
Let's visualise the 10 words per topic with the highest beta:
```{r}
ap_topics %>%
  group_by(topic) %>%
  slice_max(beta, n = 10) %>% 
  ungroup() %>%
  arrange(topic, -beta) %>%
  mutate(term = reorder_within(term, beta, topic)) %>% # reorder_within() necessary due to facet_wrap()
  ggplot(aes(beta, term, fill = factor(topic))) +
  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~ topic, scales = "free") +
  scale_y_reordered() + # also necessary because of reordering with facets
  theme_minimal()
```

So what could topic 1 and topic 2 represent/which label(s) could we give them?
(1) business/finance
(2) politics

Note: there's overlap (e.g. two, year(s) appear in both topics)


### Document-topic probabilities
Per-document-per-topic probabilities
Same command as before, but matrix = "gamma" to extract this information

```{r}
ap_documents <- tidy(ap_lda, matrix = "gamma")
ap_documents
```

gamma = estimated proportion of words from that document that are generated from that topic
e.g. for document 1: 25% of words are from topic 1 (and 75% from topic 2)
document 18: Almost all words from topic 2

Let's have a look:
```{r}
tidy(AssociatedPress) %>% 
  filter(document == 18) %>% 
  arrange(desc(count))
```
Looks like this was classified correctly (politics)


## Testing the method
To see how accurate the LDA is, we can give it a problem that we know the answer to:
Texts from three different books, but without the titles
-> Use topic modeling (with k = 3) to cluster the texts into three topics
-> Check if these topics represent the three original books

Data:
```{r}
titles <- c("Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea", 
            "Pride and Prejudice", 
            "Great Expectations")

books <- gutenberg_works(title %in% titles) %>%
  gutenberg_download(meta_fields = "title", 
                     mirror = "http://mirrors.xmission.com/gutenberg/")
```

### Data wrangling
This is the full text of each of these books, so we'll need to do some data wrangling to get it into the correct format for LDA.
First, let's divide each book in this data frame into chapters. The chapters will be our "documents" for topic modeling.
```{r}
(by_chapter <- books %>%
  group_by(title) %>%
  mutate(chapter = cumsum( # start at 0 and count up by 1 every time you...
    str_detect(text, regex("^chapter ", ignore_case = TRUE))) # find chapter/CHAPTER at the beginning of a line
    ) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  filter(chapter > 0) %>%
  unite(col = document, # create a new column "document" that contains
        title, chapter)) # title and chapter separated by _ by default
```

...then, split the text up into words:
```{r}
(by_chapter_word <- by_chapter %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, text))
```

Finally, we'll count how often each word occurs in each chapter:
```{r}
(word_counts <- by_chapter_word %>%
  anti_join(stop_words) %>%
  count(document, word, sort = TRUE))
```
This code returns a dataframe with the columns
- document (book_chapter)
- word
- frequency

### Converting into matrix
But the LDA function needs a document term matrix as input. We can convert to that format with `cast_dtm()`:
```{r}
chapters_dtm <- word_counts %>%
  cast_dtm(document, word, n)
```

**What is a document term matrix?**
- each row contains one term, which document it comes from, and its frequency
- but: if a term doesn't appear in a document, frequency = 0 is added
-> different to our word_counts data frame
"sparse" = most rows have a frequency of 0

### LDA and analysis
```{r}
chapters_lda <- LDA(chapters_dtm, 
                    k = 3, 
                    control = list(seed = 1234))
chapters_lda
```

### Per-topic-per-word probabilities
```{r}
chapter_topics <- tidy(chapters_lda, matrix = "beta")
chapter_topics
```
Interpretation:
- probability of term being generated from each topic
- e.g. "joe" highest probability to be generated from topic 1, lowest probability from topic 2

**Top five terms for each topic**
```{r}
chapter_topics %>%
  group_by(topic) %>%
  slice_max(beta, n = 10) %>% 
  ungroup() %>%
  arrange(topic, -beta) %>% 
  mutate(term = reorder_within(term, beta, topic)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(beta, term, fill = factor(topic))) +
  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~ topic, scales = "free") +
  scale_y_reordered() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = expression(beta))
```

Looks like it worked!
Topic 1: Great Expectations 
Topic 2: Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea
Topic 3: Pride and Prejudice

### Per-document-per-topic
```{r}
chapters_gamma <- tidy(chapters_lda, matrix = "gamma")
chapters_gamma
```

Check if the LDA distinguished the three books well:
```{r}
chapters_gamma <- chapters_gamma %>%
  separate(document, c("title", "chapter"), # opposite of unite
           sep = "_", convert = TRUE) # to treat chapter as integer

chapters_gamma
```

Visualise:
```{r}
chapters_gamma %>%
  ggplot(aes(factor(topic), gamma)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_wrap(~ title) +
  labs(x = "topic", y = expression(gamma)) +
  theme_bw()
```
The algorithm does well overall, but struggles with Great Expectations

Let's find the topic most associated with each chapter:
```{r}
(chapter_classifications <- chapters_gamma %>%
  group_by(title, chapter) %>%
  slice_max(gamma) %>% # default n is 1
  ungroup())
```

Compare to the consensus topic (= the most common topic among its chapters)
```{r}
(book_topics <- chapter_classifications %>%
  count(title, topic) %>%
  group_by(title) %>%
  slice_max(n, n = 1) %>% 
  ungroup() %>%
  transmute(consensus = title, topic)) # drop any other columns
```

### By word assignments: augment
`augment()` lets us add information from a model to a dataframe. Here, we're adding the assigned topic from `chapters_lda` to the original data frame with documents, words, and their counts.
```{r}
assignments <- augment(chapters_lda, 
                       data = chapters_dtm)
assignments
```

Compare this with the consensus book titles (= assigned book titles):
```{r}
assignments <- assignments %>%
  separate(document, c("title", "chapter"), 
           sep = "_", convert = TRUE) %>%
  inner_join(book_topics, by = c(".topic" = "topic"))

assignments
```

Visualize this in a confusion matrix:
```{r}
assignments %>%
  count(title, consensus, wt = count) %>%
  mutate(across(c(title, consensus), 
                ~str_wrap(., 20))) %>% # add line breaks to long titles
  group_by(title) %>%
  mutate(percent = n / sum(n)) %>%
  ungroup() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(consensus, title, fill = percent)) +
  geom_tile() +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "lightblue", high = "darkred",
                      label = scales::percent_format()) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1),
        panel.grid = element_blank()) +
  labs(x = "Book words were assigned to",
       y = "Book words came from",
       fill = "% of assignments")
```

What were the most commonly mistaken words?
```{r}
assignments %>%
  filter(title != consensus) %>%
  count(title, consensus, term, wt = count) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  arrange(desc(n))
```


# Try it out!

Apply topic modeling to Beyoncé's and/or Taylor Swift's lyrics! You can use songs or albums as documents.
Another idea would be to see if topic modeling can distinguish between Beyoncé's and Taylor's lyrics.
```{r}
beyonce <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-09-29/beyonce_lyrics.csv')
taylor_swift <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-09-29/taylor_swift_lyrics.csv')

str(taylor_swift)

str(beyonce)
```

For visualisations, note that there are packages with colour palettes for both artists:
- https://github.com/asteves/tayloRswift
- https://github.com/dill/beyonce

Since these are song lyrics, it might also be useful to exclude words that are not included in the usual stopword lists (such as "ah", "uh", "whoa").


FYI - another example: Spice Girls lyrics, as in this post by Julia Silge:
https://juliasilge.com/blog/spice-girls/



## Topic modeling Taylor Swift lyrics
```{r}
(taylor_album <- taylor_swift %>% 
  mutate(Lyrics = str_replace_all(Lyrics, "\n", " ")) %>% # replace \n with spaces
  unnest_tokens(word, Lyrics) %>% 
  anti_join(stop_words) %>% 
  filter(!word %in% c("ooh", "whoa", "yeah", "ah", "uh")) %>% 
  group_by(Album) %>% 
  count(word, sort= TRUE))
```

Convert to matrix:
```{r}
taylor_matrix <- taylor_album %>% 
  cast_dtm(Album, word, n)
taylor_matrix
```

Run LDA:
```{r}
taylor_lda <- LDA(taylor_matrix, 
              k = 8, 
              control = list(seed = 1234))
taylor_lda
```

Extract and visualise word-topic probabilities:
```{r}
tidy(taylor_lda, matrix = "beta")%>%
  group_by(topic) %>%
  slice_max(beta, n = 10, with_ties = FALSE) %>% 
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(topic = paste("Topic", topic)) %>%
  arrange(topic, -beta) %>%
  mutate(term = reorder_within(term, beta, topic)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(beta, term, fill = factor(topic))) +
  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~ topic, scales = "free", nrow = 2) +
  scale_y_reordered() +
  theme_minimal() +
  tayloRswift::scale_fill_taylor(palette = "lover") +
  labs(x = "per-topic-per-word probability beta", y = "",
       title = "Topic modeling results for Taylor Swift's songs",
       caption = "Data: TidyTuesday\nColour palette: {tayloRswift}") +
  theme(plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

## Topic modeling Beyoncé lyrics
```{r}
beyonce_songs <- beyonce %>%  
  unnest_tokens(word, line) %>% 
  anti_join(stop_words) %>% 
  filter(!word %in% c("ooh", "whoa", "yeah", "ah", "uh", "ya", "hey")) %>%
  group_by(song_name) %>% 
  count(word) %>% 
  ungroup()

beyonce_mat <- beyonce_songs %>% 
  cast_dtm(song_name, word, n)

beyonce_lda <- LDA(beyonce_mat,
                   k = 6,
                   control = list(seed = 1234))

tidy(beyonce_lda, matrix = "beta")%>%
  group_by(topic) %>%
  slice_max(beta, n = 10, with_ties = FALSE) %>% 
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(topic = paste("Topic", topic)) %>%
  arrange(topic, -beta) %>%
  mutate(term = reorder_within(term, beta, topic)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(beta, term, fill = factor(topic))) +
  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~ topic, scales = "free", nrow = 2) +
  scale_y_reordered() +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = beyonce_palette(18)) +
  labs(x = "per-topic-per-word probability (beta)", y = "",
       title = "Topic modeling results for Beyoncé's songs",
       caption = "Data: TidyTuesday\nColour palette: {beyonce} 18") +
  theme(plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```


## Can topic modeling distinguish Taylor Swift's from Beyoncé's lyrics?
```{r}
beyonce_songs <- beyonce_songs %>% 
  mutate(artist = "Beyoncé") %>% 
  unite(col = document,
        artist, song_name)

taylor_songs <- taylor_swift %>% 
  mutate(Lyrics = str_replace_all(Lyrics, "\n", " ")) %>% # replace \n with spaces
  unnest_tokens(word, Lyrics) %>% 
  anti_join(stop_words) %>% 
  filter(!word %in% c("ooh", "whoa", "yeah", "ah", "uh", "ya", "hey")) %>% 
  group_by(Title) %>% 
  count(word, sort= TRUE) %>% 
  mutate(artist = "Taylor Swift") %>% 
  unite(col = document,
        artist, Title)

both_songs <- bind_rows(beyonce_songs, taylor_songs) %>% 
  cast_dtm(document, word, n)

both_songs_lda <- LDA(both_songs,
                      k = 2,
                      control = list(seed = 1234))
```

Top 15 words per topic:
```{r}
tidy(both_songs_lda, matrix = "beta") %>% 
  group_by(topic) %>%
  slice_max(beta, n = 15) %>% 
  ungroup() %>%
  arrange(topic, -beta) %>% 
  mutate(term = reorder_within(term, beta, topic)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(beta, term, fill = factor(topic))) +
  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~ topic, scales = "free") +
  scale_y_reordered() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = expression(beta))
```

```{r}
tidy(both_songs_lda, matrix = "gamma") %>%
  separate(document, c("artist", "song"), # opposite of unite
           sep = "_", convert = TRUE) %>%
  ggplot(aes(factor(topic), gamma)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_wrap(~ artist) +
  labs(x = "topic", y = expression(gamma)) +
  theme_bw()
```
