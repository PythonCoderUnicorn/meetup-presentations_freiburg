# Preparation

## Choosing the data

As everyone always says,

> penguins are very cute!

::: fragment
...so let's work with penguin data today.  
:::

More information on this data set is available on [Allison Horst's Github page.](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/)  

This data can also be used via the {palmerpenguins} package [@Horst.2020] and was originally introduced in @Gorman.2014  


## Loading packages & reading data

First, we need to:  
1. load **packages**  
2. read in **data**  
3. check if that data is *in the right format*  

```{r library and data, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
penguins <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-07-28/penguins.csv') %>% 
  drop_na()
head(penguins)
```

We've removed missing values here, which means that the data has `r nrow(penguins)` rows now.


## Some descriptive statistics

```{r penguin pic, echo = FALSE, out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("penguin_species.PNG")
```

. . .

The average bill length is `r mean(penguins$bill_length_mm)` mm and the average bill depth is `r mean(penguins$bill_depth_mm)` mm. <br>
The data was collected between `r min(penguins$year)` and `r max(penguins$year)`.


# Graphs

Some ideas for graphs:

* penguin weight by flipper length  
    + for the entire data  
    + or separately for each species  
    + and additionally by sex  
* flipper and bill length  
* bill length and depth  

## Weight and flipper length

The following graphs are slightly simplified versions from the [vignette for the {palmerpenguins} package.](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/articles/examples.html)

### Entire data
```{r}
mass_flipper <- ggplot(data = penguins,
                       aes(x = flipper_length_mm,
                           y = body_mass_g)) +
  geom_point(size = 3,
             alpha = 0.8) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Penguin size, Palmer Station LTER",
       subtitle = "Flipper length and body mass for Adelie, Chinstrap and Gentoo Penguins",
       x = "Flipper length (mm)",
       y = "Body mass (g)") +
  theme_minimal()
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
mass_flipper
```
